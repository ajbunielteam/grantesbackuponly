FIX YOUR IMAGES - RUN THIS SQL NOW!

The problem: Your images column is TEXT which can only hold 65,535 bytes.
Your images are 65,535 bytes - they're being TRUNCATED!

SOLUTION:
1. Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Click on grantes_db
3. Click on SQL tab
4. Copy and paste this ENTIRE SQL:

ALTER TABLE admin_posts MODIFY COLUMN images MEDIUMTEXT;

5. Click "Go"
6. After that runs successfully, run this to clean up:

DELETE FROM admin_posts WHERE LENGTH(images) = 65535;

7. Click "Go" again
8. Now refresh your GranTES page
9. Try posting an image again

Images will now work!
