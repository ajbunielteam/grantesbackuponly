IMPORTANT: Increase MySQL Packet Size

The image you're trying to upload is too large (1MB) and exceeds MySQL's max_allowed_packet limit.

TO FIX THIS:

1. Stop MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel
2. Edit this file: C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini
3. Find the section [mysqld]
4. Add or modify this line:
   max_allowed_packet=10M
5. Save the file
6. Start MySQL again in XAMPP Control Panel
7. Try uploading your photo again

ALTERNATIVE: Restart MySQL with command:
   net stop mysql
   net start mysql
