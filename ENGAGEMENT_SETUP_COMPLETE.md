## What Has Been Implemented

Your GranTES system now has fully functional engagement features (Likes, Comments, Shares) connected to MySQL database!

### Features Added:

2. **Comment System** - Users can add comments to posts
3. **Share System** - Users can share posts
4. **Real-time Updates** - All engagement data is saved to MySQL
5. **Cross-user System** - Works for both Admin and Students

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
- `api/update_post_engagement.php` - Handles engagement updates (likes, comments, shares)
- `api/setup_engagement_columns.php` - Automatic database setup script
- `api/test_database.php` - Test database connection and columns
- `update_posts_engagement.sql` - Manual SQL setup script
- `MYSQL_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions

### Files Modified:
- `script.js` - Added engagement functions for both admin and students
- `api/get_posts.php` - Updated to return engagement counts
- `api/save_post.php` - Updated to initialize engagement columns
- `api-config.js` - Added engagement API function
- `style.css` - Added engagement UI styles

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start XAMPP MySQL
Make sure MySQL is running in XAMPP Control Panel

### Step 2: Run Setup Script
Open in browser:
```
http://localhost/grantes/api/setup_engagement_columns.php
```

This will add the required columns to your database automatically.

### Step 3: Test It!
Navigate to:
```
http://localhost/grantes/
```

Login and click Like/Comment/Share on any post!

## Testing the Connection

Visit this URL to test your database connection:
```
http://localhost/grantes/api/test_database.php
```

This will show you:
- Database connection status
- Existing columns
- Missing columns (if any)

## How It Works

### For Admins:
- Click Like/Comment/Share on their own posts
- See engagement metrics in admin dashboard
- Comments are stored with "Administrator" as author

### For Students:
- View admin announcements
- Interact with Like/Comment/Share buttons
- Comments are stored with student's name as author
- All engagement is saved to MySQL database

### Database Structure:
```sql
admin_posts table:
- likes (INT) - Number of likes
- shares (INT) - Number of shares  
- comments (TEXT/JSON) - Array of comment objects
  Example: [{"id": 123, "author": "John Doe", "content": "Great!", "timestamp": "2025-01-01 12:00:00"}]
```

## API Endpoints

### Update Engagement:
```
POST /grantes/api/update_post_engagement.php
Body: {
  "postId": 1,
  "action": "like" | "comment" | "share",
  "comment": "optional comment text",
  "author": "author name"
}
```

## UI Design Features

- **Vertical Metrics Layout**: Numbers displayed above labels
- **Color-coded Hover States**:
  - Like button â†’ Blue
  - Comment button â†’ Green  
  - Share button â†’ Orange
- **Smooth Transitions**: All interactions have hover effects
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for each action

## Troubleshooting

### If engagement isn't working:
1. Check MySQL is running in XAMPP
2. Run setup_engagement_columns.php
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify API endpoint is accessible

### If columns don't exist:
Run the manual SQL:
```sql
USE grantes_db;
ALTER TABLE admin_posts ADD COLUMN likes INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE admin_posts ADD COLUMN shares INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE admin_posts ADD COLUMN comments TEXT DEFAULT '[]';
```

## Next Steps

Everything is ready to use! Just:
1. Run the setup script
2. Login to your system
3. Start engaging with posts!

The engagement data will persist in your MySQL database and be available to all users in real-time.

Enjoy your fully functional engagement system! ðŸŽ‰
